# 🚗 CO2 Emissions Predictor

**CO2 Emissions Predictor** is a machine learning application that uses a **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** model to predict the carbon dioxide emissions (g/km) of a vehicle based on its engine size (L). This project demonstrates how to build, evaluate, and deploy a regression model using Python and Streamlit.

## 🌟 Features
- **Simple Linear Regression (SLR) Model**: Efficient and accurate prediction of CO2 emissions based on engine size.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an intuitive experience.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Adjust engine size dynamically to get instant CO2 emission predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays scatterplots of sample data with the regression line for better understanding.
- **Eco-Friendly Insights**: Learn about the relationship between engine size and emissions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive web application.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for training the SLR model.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Input Engine Size**: Use the slider to select the engine size (in liters).
2. **Real-Time Prediction**: The app instantly predicts the CO2 emissions based on the input.
3. **Visualize Data**: See a scatterplot of engine size vs. CO2 emissions along with the regression line.

## 📊 Sample Data
Here is an example of the dataset used for training the SLR model:

| Engine Size (L)  | CO2 Emissions (g/km) |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 1.5              | 145                  |
| 2.0              | 185                  |
| 3.0              | 250                  |
| 4.0              | 320                  |
| 5.0              | 400                  |
